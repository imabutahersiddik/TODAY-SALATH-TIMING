# TODAY SALATH TIMING 

THIS PROJECT WAS DONE BY USING THE OPEN-SOURCE [ALADHAN API](HTTPS://ALADHAN.COM/) WHICH HAS MANY ISLAMIC API OPTIONS TO USE IN ISLAMIC SITES OR SITES VISITED BY MUSLIMS.

## WHAT IS SALAT TIMES API?

SALAT TIMES API HAS MANY ENDPOINTS THAT RETURN JSON INCLUDING THE FIVE SALATS TIMES IN A SPECIFIC CITY, COUNTRY, ADDRESS, OR AN EXACT MONTH OF THE YEAR.

## TIMINGS BY CITY

IN THIS PROJECT I USED THE TIMING BY CITY ENDPOINT TO SEARCH FOR SALAT TIMES BASED ON THE CITY WRITTEN.
